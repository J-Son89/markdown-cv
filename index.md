# Jamie Caprani, Software Developer

I am a Software Developer with over five years professional experience. For the past three years I worked as a Software Engineer on a innovate project which grew from a small component library to a platform for frontend development projects for custumers of the company. My core focus was desigining upgradability tooling and protocols. I was an advocate in this project for clean and maintainable code and simple, future proofed solutions to any technical problems.

I enjoy the technical problem solving aspect of computer science and also the creative process of implementing elegant designs with intuitive UX.

As a worker I often receive praise for my ability to reach deadlines and contributing to positive, focused team spirit. I relish a steep challenge and ambitious targets to motivate my progress.

I am highly educated and experienced, this combined with my interpersonal skills offers a very well-rounded and professional asset to any software development team.
